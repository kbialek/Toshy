"""
Keyboard layout analyzer (XKB) for Toshy.

File: toshy_common/kblayout_analyze.py

Ingests an XKB keymap — either from explicit RMLVO names (for testing a
specific layout) or from a raw keymap string (as a Wayland compositor hands
it over through the wl_keyboard keymap fd) — and reports, per key, which
symbols sit at each shift level and which modifier combinations actually
reach those levels. It can additionally diff the active layout against a
reference (normally plain US) and mark how each key diverges, and derive the
sparse keycode->keycode correction map the keymapper consumes.

This module is a pure analysis building block. It has no hooks into the
keymapper's event pipeline and does no live detection: importing it pulls in
the xkbcommon package but otherwise does nothing until its methods are called
explicitly. Acquisition lives in kblayout_detect; orchestration (re-analyze on
layout change and hand the result to the keymapper) lives in kblayout_context.

The central correctness point, learned the hard way: an XKB "level" index
does NOT have a fixed, layout-wide meaning. The mapping from "modifiers held"
to "level reached" is defined per key by that key's *key type*. So level 2 is
the AltGr level on a four-level alphabetic key, does not exist on a two-level
key, and means something tied to NumLock on a keypad key. The authoritative
source for "what produces this level" is key_get_mods_for_level(), which is
already key-type aware. This module trusts that function and keeps NO global
level-to-modifier table.

Two further subtleties this module bakes in:
  - key_get_mods_for_level() returns a LIST of alternative masks. Each entry
    is a separate, individually-sufficient way to reach the level (e.g. an
    alphabetic key reaches its capital via Shift alone OR Lock/Caps alone).
    They are OR-alternatives, never an AND set, so they are reported that way.
  - Masks are bitfields over real + virtual modifier indices, as named by
    mod_get_name(). AltGr may appear as the real "Mod5" on one keymap and as
    the virtual "LevelThree" on another; NumLock appears as "Mod2". The display
    annotates the common ones without altering the raw data.

Comparison model: the diff is keyed by modifier COMBINATION, not by level
index, because two layouts can give the same key different key types, so
"level 2 here" and "level 2 there" need not be reached by the same modifiers.
For each key, the union of every modifier combination either side defines is
walked, and each combination is judged:
  - changed  (both define it, symbols differ)            -> mark '!!!'
  - added    (active defines it, reference does not)     -> mark '+++'
  - dropped  (reference defines it, active does not)     -> mark '---'
A combination that exists on only one side is exactly how a level-count
mismatch surfaces, so that case needs no special handling.
