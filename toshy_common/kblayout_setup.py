"""
Wiring that connects keyboard-layout detection to the keymapper.

    toshy_common/kblayout_setup.py

Bridges the two sides that deliberately do not import each other: it reads the
keymapper's opt-in flags (set in the config via keyboard_layout_correction) and,
when enabled, starts the detection coordinator with its callback pointed at the
keymapper's correction-map setter. Living here rather than inline in the config
means the config only declares the option and calls one function — all the
coordinator construction, the watcher-thread callback, the option translation,
and the coordinator's lifetime are held in this one place.

The keymapper-side imports are guarded: on a keymapper build that predates the
correction API, this module still imports cleanly and start_kblayout_correction()
reports the feature unavailable and does nothing, so Toshy keeps loading against
an older keymapper.
