# Repo location: toshy/nix/nixos-scaffold.sh

# EXPERIMENTAL. Generates a system flake for a fresh NixOS install that has
# no existing /etc/nixos/flake.nix, wiring in the Toshy NixOS module, Home
# Manager, and the Toshy Home Manager module, so that the standard Toshy
# NixOS setup instructions can be followed from a stock installation.
#
# This script is deliberately unprivileged and never modifies any existing
# file. It writes its output to ./toshy-scaffold/flake.nix in the current
# directory and prints the commands to review and place it. If a system
# flake already exists, it refuses and points at the manual instructions
# in nix/README.md instead.
#
# NixOS only. On SteamOS (or any other distro), even with the Nix package
# manager installed, there is no nixos-rebuild and no /etc/nixos, so this
# scaffold does not apply. See nix/README.md for what does.
