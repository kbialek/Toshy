# Repo location: toshy/nix/toshy-runtime.nix
#
# EXPERIMENTAL. Builds the externally managed Toshy Python runtime:
# a Python environment holding all Toshy/xwaykeyz dependencies, with
# bin entries wrapped so GTK/AppIndicator gobject-introspection typelibs
# and GSettings schemas are visible (needed by the tray and the GTK4
# preferences app; the keymapper itself does not need them).
#
# The result is meant to be linked (by the home-manager module) at:
#     ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/toshy/runtime
# where Toshy's launcher scripts resolve it via toshy-runtime-env.sh.
