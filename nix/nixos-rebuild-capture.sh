# EXPERIMENTAL. Convenience wrapper for the (first) flake-based NixOS
# rebuild: runs 'nixos-rebuild switch' with the experimental features
# enabled on the command line (required until one rebuild has succeeded,
# harmless afterward), shows the output live, keeps a full log, and on
# failure offers to upload the log to a public paste service and print
# the short URL, for machines where the clipboard is not available.
#
# Run from anywhere (typically the extracted Toshy zip/clone):
#     bash ./nix/nixos-rebuild-capture.sh
