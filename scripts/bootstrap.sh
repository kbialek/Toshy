# Toshy Installation Bootstrap Script
# https://github.com/RedBearAK/toshy

# shellcheck disable=SC2034
VERSION='20260731'

# NOTE: This is deliberately the ONLY script in the repo written for POSIX
# 'sh' instead of the usual '#!/usr/bin/env bash'. It is the one script that
# must run BEFORE Toshy's native package install has had a chance to put
# 'bash' (or anything else) on the system. Some distros with busybox userland
# (e.g. Alpine) ship no bash at all, only 'ash' as /bin/sh. Every other
# script in the repo runs post-install and may assume bash freely.
#
# Consequences kept in mind throughout this file:
#   - No '[[ ]]' tests, no process substitution, no arrays.
#   - No 'read -p' (busybox ash has it, but dash — /bin/sh on Debian/Ubuntu —
#     does not). Prompts are printed separately with 'printf'.
#   - busybox 'wget' only understands a short-option subset, so downloads
#     stick to flags valid for both GNU and busybox wget.

# NOTE: deliberately no 'set -e'. Every command that matters is checked
# explicitly below. And 'set -e' is silently disabled inside if/&&/||/!
# conditions anyway, so it provides partial coverage while looking like
# total coverage.

# Store the original directory
ORIGINAL_DIR="$(pwd)"

# Source archives come from codeload, which serves a tarball for ANY ref: a
# branch name, a tag, or a commit SHA (full or abbreviated). Fetching an archive
# means 'git' is NOT required to install Toshy. That matters, because 'git' is
# not preinstalled on many desktop distros, and it is Toshy's own native package
# install that puts it there. Requiring it just to bootstrap was backwards.
